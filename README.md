# sequence

Sequence is a module containing packages around building, manipulating, and extracting data from "sequences". Sequences are a lazily processed type generated from either a concrete type, a generator method, or from another sequence. Processing is normally delayed until extracting the data from the sequence.

## Warning

This package is in the process of being built up and protoyped without much of a clear design in mind. It's currently about playing around during [Advent of Code (2023)](https://adventofcode.com/) and building up some utilities.

These packages are very much in flux, and can change in an instant. As a result, I'm not really going to look at the community tabs at all, respond to any issues, or accept pull requests. This is very much not for public consumption at the moment.
